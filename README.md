# Phishing Simulation Framework

A comprehensive phishing simulation engine designed for cybersecurity research, security awareness training, and detection system development. This framework generates realistic phishing scenarios using synthetic data while maintaining strict ethical guidelines.

## Overview

This simulation framework combines behavioral psychology, machine learning, and advanced analytics to create realistic phishing training environments. Unlike simple awareness tools, it models the complete attack lifecycle from initial targeting through credential compromise, providing organizations with data-driven insights into their security posture.

## Key Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates realistic recipient profiles and email content without real-world impact
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Implements psychology-based user interaction models 
- **Machine Learning Detection**: Multi-algorithm approach with feature importance analysis
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Executive dashboards and technical analysis visualizations
- **AI Integration**: Prompts for advanced analysis using large language models
- **Ethical Safety**: Built-in controls prevent malicious use

## Core Components

- **Recipient Generator**: Creates psychologically realistic user profiles with role-based vulnerability modeling
- **Template Engine**: Generates sophisticated phishing content across multiple attack vectors
- **Interaction Simulator**: Models human decision-making patterns and response behaviors
- **Feature Extractor**: Multi-dimensional content analysis for ML training
- **Detection System**: Comparative analysis of rule-based vs ML-based detection methods
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Stakeholder-appropriate views of simulation results

## Quick Start

```python
# Run complete simulation
from src.main import run_phishing_simulation

results = run_phishing_simulation(
    num_recipients=800,
    campaign_size=400,
    test_size=0.3
)

# Display results
results['visualizations']['campaign_overview'].show()
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/phishing-simulation-framework.git
cd phishing-simulation-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Use Cases

- **Security Awareness Training**: Identify high-risk user segments and behaviors
- **Detection System Development**: Train and validate phishing detection algorithms  
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Understand organizational susceptibility patterns
- **Research**: Academic study of human factors in cybersecurity

## Ethical Guidelines

This framework is designed exclusively for defensive cybersecurity purposes:

- All data is synthetic and clearly marked as test content
- Safety mechanisms prevent real-world email sending
- Domain isolation uses reserved .test domains only
- Educational licensing restricts malicious usage

## Sample Output

The framework generates comprehensive visualizations including:
- Campaign performance metrics and timeline analysis
- ML model performance with ROC curves and feature importance
- User behavior patterns and susceptibility analysis
- Threat landscape mapping and detection effectiveness

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- nltk, plotly, wordcloud, textstat
- faker for synthetic data generation

## Contributing

Contributions welcome for:
- Enhanced behavioral modeling algorithms
- Additional attack vector templates
- Integration with security platforms
- Academic research validation
